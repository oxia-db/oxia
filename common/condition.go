// ConditionContext implements a condition variable, a rendezvous point
// for goroutines waiting for or announcing the occurrence
// of an event.
//
// This version of condition takes a `context.Context` in the `Wait()`
// method, to allow for timeouts and cancellations of the operation.
type ConditionContext interface {
	// Wait atomically unlocks the locker and suspends execution
	// of the calling goroutine. After later resuming execution,
	// Wait locks c.L before returning. Unlike in other systems,
	// Wait cannot return unless awoken by Broadcast or Signal.
	//
	// Because c.L is not locked when Wait first resumes, the caller
	// typically cannot assume that the condition is true when
	// Wait returns. Instead, the caller should Wait in a loop:
	//
	//	lock.Lock()
	//	for !condition() {
	//	    c.Wait(ctx)
	//	}
	//	... make use of condition ...
	//	lock.Unlock()
	Wait(ctx context.Context) error

	// Signal wakes one goroutine waiting on c, if there is any.
	//
	// It is allowed but not required for the caller to hold c.L
	// during the call.
	//
	// Signal() does not affect goroutine scheduling priority; if other goroutines
	// are attempting to lock c.L, they may be awoken before a "waiting" goroutine.
	Signal()

	// Broadcast wakes all goroutines waiting on c.
	//
	// It is allowed but not required for the caller to hold c.L
	// during the call.
