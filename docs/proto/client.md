### ErrorType
Represents all the possible errors and that can be encountered.

<a name="io-streamnative-oxia-client-OxiaClient"></a>

### OxiaClient
Oxia service that allows clients to discover shard-to-server assignments and
submit batches of requests.

Clients should connect to a random server to discover the shard-to-server
assignments and then send the actual batched requests to the appropriate
shard leader. In the future, this may be handled server-side in a proxy
layer to allows clients to not be concerned with sharding.

| Method Name | Request Type | Response Type | Description |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------|
| ShardAssignments | [ShardAssignmentsRequest](#io-streamnative-oxia-client-ShardAssignmentsRequest) | [ShardAssignmentsResponse](#io-streamnative-oxia-client-ShardAssignmentsResponse) stream | Gets all shard-to-server assignments as a stream. Each set of assignments in the response stream will contain all the assignments to bring the client up to date. For example, if a shard is split, the stream will return a single response containing all the new shard assignments as opposed to multiple stream responses, each containing a single shard assignment.

Clients should connect to a single random server which will stream the assignments for all shards on all servers. |
| Batch | [BatchRequest](#io-streamnative-oxia-client-BatchRequest) | [BatchResponse](#io-streamnative-oxia-client-BatchResponse) | Batches put, delete, delete_range, get and get_range requests.

Clients should send this request to the shard leader. In the future, this may be handled server-side in a proxy layer. |
