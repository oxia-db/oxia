# Getting started with Oxia


## Obtaining Oxia

## Docker image

Oxia is available in form of a Docker image

```shell
$ docker pull streamnative/oxia:main
```

## Building from source

```shell
$ make
```

This will create the binary file on `bin/oxia`.

## Oxia standalone

Oxia standalone is a single-node single-process instance of Oxia that can started with little or no configuration.
It provides a full-fledged Oxia service with a `default` namespace. Being a single-node instance, the data is not
getting replicated.

```shell
$ oxia standalone
```

Output will be something like:

```

Mar 30 16:51:40.566760 INF Serving Prometheus metrics at http://localhost:8080/metrics
```

The service is now ready at `localhost:6648` address.

Using docker this can be done with:

```shell
$ docker run -p 6648:6648 streamnative/oxia:main oxia standalone 
```


## Using Oxia CLI client

There is a convenient CLI tool that allows you to interact with the records stored in Oxia.

```shell
# Write or update a record
$ bin/oxia client put -k /my-key -v my-value
{"version":{"version_id":0,"created_timestamp":1680220430128,"modified_timestamp":1680220430128,"modifications_count":0}}


# Read the value of a key
$ oxia client get -k /my-key
{"binary":false,"value":"my-value","version":{"version_id":0,"created_timestamp":1680220430128,"modified_timestamp":1680220430128,"modifications_count":0}}
```

## Using perf client

If you want to do a quick assessment of the capacity of an Oxia cluster, you can use the provided `perf` tool, which 
generates some amount of traffic, based on the desired rate and read/write ratio.


```shell
$ oxia perf --rate 10000
