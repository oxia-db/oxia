### Why Oxia

Oxia offers a sharding architecture designed to efficiently manage distributed metadata. In the world of cloud-native applications, scalability and high availability are essential. Traditional systems with a shard-nothing architecture are great for consistency but often face limitations when handling extremely large datasets or high-throughput scenarios. This is where Oxia shines.

With Oxia, you get a scalable, robust, and flexible solution for managing metadata in distributed systems, allowing you to unlock the potential of modern cloud-native architectures.
